# Golem

Golem is a local-first orchestration layer for agentic coding harnesses. It adds
shared roles, a SQLite-backed tracker and dashboard, session discovery, durable
delivery, lifecycle journals, and evidence-based verification without replacing
the native harness.

The canonical source is [`substrate/`](substrate/). Harness adapters render it
into the native surfaces each harness supports. The dashboard is the tracker’s
single writer; hooks, shims, and MCP tools connect live sessions to it.

## Supported harnesses

| Harness | Current support | Start with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Tier A through the managed private bridge; a separately launched `codex` is pull-only | `golem codex` |
| Claude Code | Tier A development-channel delivery; plain `claude` can pull work only | `golem claude` |
| OpenCode | Tier A checkout-bound shim and bridge; opt-in | `opencode` after sync |
| Pi | Tier A worker with typed delivery; Node.js 22.19+ and Pi 0.80.10 | `golem pi` |
| Gemini CLI | Unsupported; no adapter or release contract is shipped | — |

The built-in roles are `lead`, `builder`, `explorer`, and `reviewer`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer and npm. Pi requires Node.js 22.19 or newer.
- Git.
- At least one supported coding harness installed separately.

## Install from a source checkout

The npm package is not the install path. Clone this repository and link its
CLI:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/laveesingh/golem.git
cd golem
npm ci
npm link
golem doctor
golem dashboard
```

Keep `golem dashboard` running. It serves the tracker and dashboard at
<http://dashboard.golem.localhost:7420>. The `*.localhost` name is reserved for
loopback by RFC 6761; no `/etc/hosts` entry is needed. The dashboard has no
authentication, so do not use `golem dashboard --public` on an untrusted network.

Choose a harness in another terminal. Run its sync command after the source
checkout install and before its first launch.

### Claude Code

```sh
golem sync --target cc
golem sync --target cc-marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add ~/.golem/renders/cc-marketplace
claude plugin install golem@golem-workspace --scope user
golem claude
```

`golem claude` supplies Claude Code's development-channel launch. A plain
`claude` session has Golem tools but must pull work. After a render update, run
`claude plugin update golem@golem-workspace` and `/reload-plugins` in existing
sessions.

### Codex

For an ordinary Codex session, render and install the local plugin marketplace,
then launch Codex:

```sh
golem sync --target codex
codex plugin marketplace add ~/.golem/renders/codex
codex plugin add golem@golem-workspace
codex
```

Ordinary `codex` delivery is pull-only. `golem codex` is the managed private
bridge and is version-gated; see [the Codex contract](docs/codex.md) before
using its managed delivery. The wrapper owns Codex's remote bridge and working
directory, so do not pass `--remote` or `-C`/`--cd` to it.

### OpenCode

OpenCode is disabled until enabled in `~/.golem/config.json`:

```json
{
  "harnesses": {
    "opencode": {
      "enabled": true,
      "modelMap": {},
      "testedVersion": null
    }
  }
}
```

Then render and launch:

```sh
golem sync --target opencode
opencode
```

OpenCode is bound to this source checkout. Sync writes an absolute
`file://.../shims/opencode/index.js` entry and an absolute MCP path into
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`; keep this checkout in place and re-run sync
if it moves. There is no portable OpenCode package in this repository.

### Pi

Install the supported Pi release separately, then render and launch a native
Pi session:

```sh
golem sync --target pi
golem pi --provider <provider> --model <model>
```

Use `golem pi --role builder`, `--role explorer`, `--role reviewer`, or
`--role lead` for a validated role preset. Pi keeps its own profile,
providers, authentication, models, extensions, and sessions; Golem does not
copy or rewrite that configuration.

## Work model

The tracker is the source of truth for cross-session work. Ticket lifecycle is
`state` only: `todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `review`, `done`, or `archived`.
Comments, dispatch, `session_notify`, and `sessions_dispatchable` provide the
coordination surface. The dashboard event ledger is durable audit history, not
a message subscription.

Sessions register their project, harness, role, and delivery capability. Golem
routes work only through a supported path: managed Codex delivery, Claude's
development channel, the OpenCode bridge, or Pi's typed-worker endpoint.

For architecture and source ownership, use [`REPO-MAP.md`](REPO-MAP.md) rather
than this README as the repository map.

## Dashboard and CLI

The dashboard serves the ticket board, session roster, chat, dispatch controls,
REST API, and WebSocket updates.

```sh
golem dashboard
golem dashboard:restart
golem status
golem doctor
golem help
```

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `golem dashboard` | Start the dashboard in the foreground. |
| `golem dashboard:restart` | Replace the registered dashboard with a detached instance. |
| `golem status [--json]` | Report dashboard health and its canonical URL. |
| `golem doctor` | Check dependencies, local state, renders, integrations, and dashboard reachability. |
| `golem sync ...` | Render or check `cc`, `cc-marketplace`, `opencode`, `codex`, and `pi` outputs. |
| `golem role <role\|clear>` | Set or clear a session role. Built-ins are `lead`, `builder`, `explorer`, and `reviewer`. |
| `golem migrate-home` | Move legacy local state to `~/.golem`, with a backup and rollback. |
| `golem codex-supervisor ...` | Run or inspect the managed Codex App Server supervisor. |

Use `golem sync --check --all` to inspect render drift. Edit `substrate/`, not
the generated `plugin/` tree. The committed `plugin/` tree is the generated CC
round-trip and rollback copy; the live install uses `~/.golem/renders/`.

## Local state and safety

Mutable state normally lives in `~/.golem/`:

- `tracker.db` — tickets, comments, dispatch records, and events.
- `projects.json`, `sessions.json`, and `session-facts.json` — project and live-session registries.
- `journals/<project_id>/hook.jsonl` — lifecycle and tool-event history.
- `renders/` and `substrate.lock` — generated harness output and drift metadata.
- `dashboard.json`, endpoint leases, and harness bridge registries — live routing.
- `ticket-assets/`, `logs/`, and Codex supervisor state — supporting local state.

`GOLEM_HOME` overrides the state root. Existing XDG installations can be moved
explicitly with `golem migrate-home`.

Journals and tracker data may contain prompts, model output, tool arguments,
paths, and other sensitive local context. Protect the state directory. Read
[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before exposing services
or sharing diagnostics.

## Development
