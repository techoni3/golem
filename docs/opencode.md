# opencode harness (P4, TKT-0576)

golem's substrate compiler renders to more than one agentic harness. Alongside
the Claude Code adapter (`--target cc`), there is an **opencode** adapter
(`--target opencode`). It is **additive and off by default** — a fresh install
never touches opencode until you opt in via the harness toggle, so it can't
break the CC path.

## Enabling

The toggle lives in `~/.golem/config.json` (created on demand; absent → all
non-default harnesses disabled):

```json
{
  "harnesses": {
    "claudecode": { "enabled": true },
    "opencode":   { "enabled": true, "modelMap": {}, "testedVersion": null }
  }
}
```

With `opencode.enabled = false` (the default), `golem sync --target opencode`
reports the harness as **disabled and skips** — it is never treated as drift.
`golem doctor` shows the same disabled status.

Then render:

```bash
golem sync --target opencode
```

## What it renders

opencode reads golem's pieces from **three** rendered locations (unlike the CC
plugin, which is one bundle), plus checkout-backed MCP and shim entries in the
managed config merge:

| Piece  | Rendered to | How opencode finds it |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Agents | `~/.config/opencode/agent/<name>.md` | opencode's **fixed** global agent dir — there is no config key to add extra agent search paths, so the files must live there physically. |
| Skills | `~/.golem/renders/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | that dir is appended to the `skills.paths` array in `opencode.jsonc`. |
| Instructions | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` and `tracker-context.md` | managed global instructions and the tracker-context snapshot in opencode's config directory. |
| MCP    | `mcp.golem` in `opencode.jsonc` | a `local` server pointing at the repo's `mcp/channel/index.js` (referenced by absolute path — no copy, unlike the CC plugin bundle). |
| Shim   | `plugin[]` in `opencode.jsonc` | a `file://` plugin pointing at the repo's `shims/opencode/index.js`; it maps lifecycle events and owns the SDK bridge. |

All three compiler render passes use the same engine (lockfile / tamper-detection / orphan
pruning) as the CC target, keyed independently by output dir.

## Dialect translation

Agent **frontmatter** is *translated*, not copied — a Claude Code agent's
`tools:` + `model:` frontmatter is invalid under opencode:

- `mode: subagent` (all three golem agents are subagents).
- `permission: { edit: deny }` for read-only agents (reviewer, researcher);
  writers (worker) get no permission block. This mirrors the one
  security-meaningful boundary — read-only agents cannot edit — rather than
  attempting a full 1:1 tool-map.
- `model` is **omitted** so the opencode session's own default model is
  inherited. (The typical opencode setup runs GPT auth with no Anthropic
  models available, so pinning `model: opus` would break the agent.
  `harnesses.opencode.modelMap` is currently reserved and not consumed.)

Agent and skill **bodies** are copied but run through the compiler's
`{{#if opencode}}` / `{{#if claudecode}}` templating, so the two CC-specific
bits render their opencode variant:

- `skills/journaling` currently renders a stale claim that `hook.jsonl` is not
  automatic under opencode. Runtime does map lifecycle, chat, and tool events
  through the shim into the same journal scripts, so the file is written
  without Claude Code's native hook manifest.
- `skills/git-conventions` — the `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` PR trailer
  becomes `[opencode]`.

Rendering the CC branch and dropping the opencode branch leaves every existing
substrate file **byte-identical** to its pre-templating form, so the CC render
is unaffected.

## Config merge safety

`opencode.jsonc` is merged with `jsonc-parser` (comment-preserving), touching
the managed `mcp.golem`, `skills.paths`, and golem shim entry in `plugin[]`,
your own keys, comments, and formatting survive, and arrays are appended to
rather than replaced. An existing file is backed up; a newly created file is
removed if validation fails. When the opencode binary is available, the result is validated with the real
`opencode debug config`; validation failure restores the previous file and fails
the sync. If the binary is unavailable, the merge is retained with a warning and
has not been runtime-validated. On successful validation the backup is removed.

## Version pinning & doctor

Sync records the running `opencode --version` in
`harnesses.opencode.testedVersion`; `golem doctor` warns on later skew and
reports render drift. An unchanged config can be repinned without rerunning
`opencode debug config`, so the pin is a compatibility target rather than proof
that every sync path validated against that version.

## Caveats

- `mcp.golem` references the repo checkout by absolute path; if you move the
  golem repo, re-run `golem sync --target opencode` to refresh the path.

## Project-scoped renders

P6 adds project-scoped substrate artifacts. A canonical substrate file can opt in
with `scope: project` in frontmatter; default is `scope: global`. Global opencode
sync ignores project-scoped files. Project sync renders only those files:

| Piece  | Project render path |
|--------|---------------------|
| Agents | `<project>/.opencode/agents/<name>.md` |
| Skills | `<project>/.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |

Session registration triggers the check for opencode sessions through the P5
shim: `session.created` calls `session-register.sh` with `harness:"opencode"`,
and the script runs `golem sync --check --project <root> --harness opencode`.
Dirty renders run detached; failures log to `~/.golem/logs/sync-on-register.log`
and never block session start.

Current artifact-set decision for P6: no real project-scoped substrate content is
shipped yet. The mechanism is verified with scratch-only fixtures so golem does
not start writing generated files into real user repos before an explicit policy
decision.

## Dispatch bridge

P5.5 makes live opencode sessions dispatchable without forking the dashboard
dispatch path. The opencode shim owns a tiny localhost bridge because it is the
only process with both the active `ses_*` id and opencode's SDK `client`; the MCP
channel server remains the dashboard-facing endpoint for the shared active
`session_notify`, `ack`, and tracker protocol. Consultation is an
ordinary `session_notify` message with an explicit advisory header and unique
reference; there are no consult wrapper tools or passive subscriptions.

Runtime flow:

- `session.created` starts/updates `~/.golem/opencode-bridges.json` with the
  `ses_*` id, opencode process pid, bridge port, cwd, and status.
- On plugin startup, the shim seeds bridge/session rows only for sessions that
  `client.session.status()` reports as active. If opencode returns no active ids,
  the shim falls back to the single most-recent top-level session only when it was
  updated recently, so persistent opencode history is not resurrected as live.
- The MCP channel process is a child of the opencode process. It resolves bridge
  rows by `process.ppid`, registers its own HTTP port in
  `~/.golem/channels.json`, and watches bridge membership/name changes so late
  sessions appear immediately; a 30-second heartbeat remains the recovery
  backstop.
- Dashboard dispatch still POSTs to the registered channel server. For opencode
  parents, the channel server forwards the push to the shim bridge; the shim
  injects the canonical `<channel source="golem" kind="...">...</channel>` text
  into the live session with `client.session.promptAsync(...)`.
  That live bridge is the OpenCode consumer-readiness signal; Claude Channels'
  Anthropic-authentication and MCP-initialization gates do not apply to it.
- `session.idle`, busy `session.status`, `chat.message`, and tool events update
  the bridge and `sessions.json` status/recency so `sessions_dispatchable` can
  show idle/busy and queue `when_idle` dispatches the same way it does for Claude
  Code sessions.
  `session.status` carries `status` as an OBJECT (`{type:"idle"|"retry"|"busy"}`);
  the shim collapses it to the plain string the dashboard compares against
  (`retry` counts as `busy`).
- The shim also records the active opencode model in `~/.golem/sessions.json`.
  It first queries the per-session value in opencode's SQLite database, then
  falls back to the runtime state file (`~/.local/state/opencode/model.json`,
  `recent[0].modelID`). Model changes are refreshed on shim-visible
  session/chat/tool/status activity; there is no idle heartbeat that fakes recent
  activity.
- `session.updated` (parentID-guarded) refreshes the registry `name` from
  `info.title` — the only real-time source of the session title (auto-generated
  after the first message, updated on rename). Events from child/subagent
  sessions can only update existing rows, never insert, so they cannot create
  phantom sessions or dispatch endpoints.
- `session.deleted`, `server.instance.disposed`, channel liveness, and opencode
  bridge pid liveness drive death. A live channel can bridge a bounded
  bridge-loss window from recent registry activity; stale activity alone does
  not create a dispatch endpoint.

The bridge is fail-open: HTTP or SDK errors are logged to
`~/.golem/logs/opencode-shim.log` and must not crash or stall opencode.
