# Golem — root workspace

This directory is the golem root: the source repo for the **golem v4 Claude Code plugin**, the **dashboard + tracker**, and the thin **`golem` CLI**. It is also a local plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`).

**Codebase map:** [REPO-MAP.md](REPO-MAP.md) — read it before exploring.

**Project memory:** [docs/memory.jsonl](docs/memory.jsonl) — append-only lessons, newest last. Read
the tail before starting anything non-trivial; append at spec close only when a future session
working on something else would be wrong without the record. Swept via `golem:docs-maintenance`.

## Layout

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| v4 plugin source | `plugin/` — agents (`worker`/`reviewer`/`researcher`), skills, hooks, channel MCP |
| Dashboard + tracker (SQLite, REST, web UI) | `dashboard/` — start with `golem dashboard` |
| `golem` CLI | `cli/golem.js` (`npm link` surfaces it; verbs: `dashboard`, `migrate-home`, `doctor`, `status`, `help`) |
| Project namespaces | `golem-projects/<name>/` (independent repos, gitignored) |
| Local marketplace manifest | `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` |
| Runtime state (outside the repo) | `~/.golem/` — `projects.json`, `sessions.json`, `channels.json`, `journals/<project_id>/`, `tracker.db`, `gates/` (ADR-4; `~/.config/golem` is a compat symlink to it post-migration — path resolution lives in `lib/golem-home.js`) |

## Journaling

The plugin hooks journal every tool call + lifecycle event to **central** `~/.golem/journals/<project_id>/hook.jsonl` — zero repo footprint. Project root is resolved by walking up from `$PWD` to the nearest `CLAUDE.md` or `.git`; sub-agents inherit routing via the same `$PWD`-walk.

## Installing the plugin

As of TKT-0575 (P3, ADR-3), Claude Code loads golem from the **workspace
render**, not the repo checkout directly:

```bash
golem sync --target cc && golem sync --target cc-marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add ~/.golem/renders/cc-marketplace
claude plugin install golem@golem-workspace --scope user
```

`plugin/` stays committed in the repo (it's the dev-checkout fallback and the
rollback target — see below) but is no longer the install source; it's a
generated, git-diff-checkable copy of `substrate/`, regenerated via `golem
sync --target cc --out ./plugin --force` when you want to prove the render
round-trips.

**Updating**: edit `substrate/`, then `golem sync --target cc` re-renders
`~/.golem/renders/cc-plugin/` and stamps the version from root
`package.json`. Bump that version, re-sync, then `claude plugin update
golem@golem-workspace` + `/reload-plugins`.

**Rollback** (repo checkout, if the workspace render ever breaks):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /Users/laveesingh/Documents/software/experiments/golem
claude plugin install golem@golem-local --scope user
```

**opencode is bound to this checkout.** `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` (outside the repo — a
reader will look in the checkout first) has a `plugin[]` entry pointing at
`shims/opencode/index.js` by absolute path, and that shim derives `REPO_ROOT` from its own
location to find `substrate/hooks/`. The shim is not rendered anywhere, so opencode integration
does not survive the repo moving or going away. `GOLEM_HOOKS_DIR` overrides the hooks path but
exists for the fail-open test, not as a way to run without the checkout.

See `substrate/README.md` for the channel-consumer launch (`golemc`) and the full setup.

## Work Choreography

The `lead` owns a workstream end to end and delegates per `golem:lead`
§ Sequence and Delegation Protocol; builders, explorers, and reviewers work
dispatched tickets and report back — durable report on the ticket first, then
`session_notify` to the delegating session. Specs, tasks, and docs live in the
tracker (`golem:tracker`); `state` is the single lifecycle. The event ledger is
durable audit history, not a wake-up or subscription path.

## Repo-specific agent rules

These are the golem-repo specifics that the global skills deliberately do not hardcode.

**Scratch tickets** (`golem:test-policy`) — smoke/scratch tickets MUST go through
`dashboard/scripts/_scratch.mjs`. They land in the quarantined `smoketests-000000` project
(`created_by: 'smoke'`, `SMOKE-` title prefix) so they never pollute a real board or burn
per-project ticket numbers. Archive them in a `finally` block.

**Worktree dependencies** (`golem:git-conventions`) — copy-on-write these from the main checkout
rather than installing:

```bash
cp -Rc node_modules .worktrees/<TICKET>-<slug>/node_modules
cp -Rc mcp/channel/node_modules .worktrees/<TICKET>-<slug>/mcp/channel/node_modules
```

**Post-merge steps** (`golem:git-conventions`) — after landing a branch on main:

- If `substrate/`, `mcp/channel/`, or compiler/render behavior changed:
  `golem sync --target cc` and `golem sync --target cc --out ./plugin --force`. Bump the root
  `package.json` version when plugin behavior changed — **the render updating is not the same as
  the installed plugin updating.**
- If `substrate/instructions/AGENTS.md` changed, also `golem sync --target codex` — root rules
  render as a marked block into `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` as well as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and the
  two are separate targets. The `pi` render also carries instructions, roles, and skills — sync
  `--target pi` too, unless uncommitted Pi work in `shims/pi/` is active in the checkout (the pi
  render bundles that shim source). `golem sync --check --all` reports every target.
- If dashboard server behavior changed, restart the dashboard from the main checkout.

**Shared runtimes to avoid inside a worktree** (the generic rule is in
`golem:git-conventions`) — `golem sync` or any render writing shared plugin/global outputs;
restarting the shared dashboard; port 7420, docker stacks, named volumes, container names;
`~/.golem` as ticket code.

## Parallel Work = Worktrees

When a dispatch brief explicitly names `workspace: worktree`, follow the
worktree directive: one ticket branch in `.worktrees/<ticket>/`, self-contained
checks only, `branch:` in the closing brief, and merge ownership per
`golem:git-conventions` § Spec branches and merge ownership (the builder merges
into the spec branch; the owner lands `main`). Ad-hoc worktrees remain
prohibited without an explicit directive.
